          <p>
            Traditional wedding photography focuses on capturing classic, posed portraits of the bride, groom, and
            wedding
            party. These photos are often taken
            in a formal setting, with careful attention paid to composition and lighting. While traditional wedding
            photography may feel more staged, it allows
            for beautiful, timeless images that will never go out of style.

            Photojournalistic wedding photography, also known as documentary
            or reportage style, takes a more candid approach to capturing your wedding day. Instead of posing for
            photos, you and your guests are photographed
            as events unfold naturally. This style aims to capture the genuine emotions and spontaneous moments that
            make your wedding unique, resulting
            in a more authentic and storytelling approach to your wedding album.

          <p>
            Fine art wedding photography takes inspiration from the world of art, aiming
            to create images that are not only beautiful but also artistic. This style often incorporates creative
            composition, dramatic lighting, and artistic
            post-processing techniques to produce stunning, ethereal images. Fine art wedding photography is perfect
            for couples who want their wedding photos
            to resemble works of art, with a focus on capturing the beauty and romance

            editing techniques to create images that have
            a soft, romantic, and timeless quality. Vintage wedding photography is perfect for couples who want to add
